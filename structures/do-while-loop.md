# Do-While loop statement
**Do-While loop** statement explained syntax, to loop a block of code until a condition is true.

The main difference between **do-while** and **while loop** statement is that:
- **do-while loop** execute the block of code, and then verify the condition;
- **while loop** do verify the condition and then execute the block of code.

For this reason, **do-while loop** execute at least one time, **while loop** does not.

## Python
**Important!** Python does **not** have a do-while loop statement.

## Perl
```perl
do {
   # Do something
} while(condition);
```

## Java
```java
do {
  // Do something
} while(condition);
```

## C++
```cpp
do {
  // Do something
} while(condition);
```
